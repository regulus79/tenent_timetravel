# Tenent Timetravel

A minetest mod for reversing the flow of time.

# Limitations

Currently, only the player and any placed/dug nodes are recorded and replayed during timetravel. Perhaps in the future, reversing entites or other game parameters such as the sky may be added.

# Usage

Use the "Reverse Time" wand to reverse the flow of time.

Alternatively, use the `/reverse` command to do the same thing.
