# Tenent Timetravel

A minetest mod for reversing the flow of time. Reverse time at will.

# Limitations

Currently, only the following things are saved and replayed during timetravel:

- Player (pos, yaw, and animation)
- Nodes (only when placed/dug; falling nodes and voxelmanip are not saved)

Perhaps in the future, reversing entites or other game parameters such as the sky may be added.

# Usage

Use the "Reverse Time" wand to reverse the flow of time.

Alternatively, use the `/reverse` command to do the same thing.
